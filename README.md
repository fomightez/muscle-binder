Binderized MUSCLE: multiple sequence alignment with high accuracy and high throughput


See [here](http://www.drive5.com/muscle/manual/) about the software.
This simply makes it available in a Jupyter session served via MyBinder.org.

Normally, I use MUSCLE via EMBL-EBI [here](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/muscle/); however, that says it is limited to 500 sequences.

I was curious if I can do more sequences elsewhere. Trying Binder first as it is suited for this type of application.
